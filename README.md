## Modules

Modules are collection of source files and build settings that allow you to divide a project into discrete units of functionality. In this case apart from dividing by functionality/responsibility, existing the following dependence between them. The project is divided into 4 Modules :

#### App module

The `:app` module is an [com.android.application](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/), which is needed to create the app bundle.

#### Core module

The `:core` module is an [com.android.library](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library) for serving network requests. Providing the data source for the many features that require it.

#### Common module

The `:common` module is an [com.android.library](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library) only contains code and resources which are shared between feature modules. Reusing this way resources, layouts, views, and components in the different features modules, without the need to duplicate code.

#### Feature module

The `:feature` module is an [com.android.library](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library) which is a module containing a specific feature, isolated from the rest in accordance with business logic.


## Testing
Local unit testing is done for ViewModel layer in `:feature` module.
